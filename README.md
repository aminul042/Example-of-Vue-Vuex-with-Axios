# Example-of-Vue-Vuex-with-Axios

## This example has been retrieved from my Laravel 9 application where webpack is used to compile all js and vue files together.
Working example of Vue Vuex with Axios for easy implementations of api end points while catching errors in on place and resolving them to the Vuex store and eventually to Vue components.

## Moduler Vuex Store
Vuex store in larage application gets very difficult to manage, so here I have used moduler approach so that different data can be stored in separate module and can be engaged in store.js as required by the component.

## Global Filters & Global helper funcitons
In addition to usage vuex and axios, the useage of global vue filters and cutom helpers funcitons have been demonstrated which are also very efficient in large application.
